These are scripts from an old failed game I tried to make in Unity.

Most of these scripts reflect my work and findings, but some belong to Unity, and I recognize them as such. Those that are displayed are
meant to show what I used in my video game and in no way do I take ownership of them as my own work. Such description can be applied to a
very small portion.
This description currently applies to:
CameraState.cs
ToneMappingColorGradient.cs

One or two others were the code of other people that I put into scripts as placeholders.
These include:
DayNightCycle.cs
